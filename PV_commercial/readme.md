**Files**
* Files initialed with "LP" are codes of the Mixed Interger Non-linear Programming approach
* Files initialed with "DP" are codes of the Dynamic Programming approach
* Files initialed with "Bsearch" are functions for ADMM algorithm to determine the system size
* Other files compared the performance, complexity, and net present value of the two approaches
